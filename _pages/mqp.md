### Throwing Robot ###
Offered for Fall2024, Spring2025, Fall2025


The goal of this MQP is to develop a robotics platform capable of performing simple throwing actions, inspired by the seminal [Tossing Bot](https://tossingbot.cs.princeton.edu/) project. This MQP focuses on developing two fundamental functionalities:

1. **Object Detection for Successful Throws**: Create a platform that detects if an object has been successfully thrown into a bin, similar to the platform used in the Tossing Bot project.
2. **Basic Throwing Action Implementation**: Implement a basic throwing action using simple ballistic equations.

### Project Details

- **Object Detection**: This functionality emphasizes design, requiring skills in CAD modeling and 3D printing.
- **Throwing Action Implementation**: This functionality focuses on software and algorithms, primarily involving programming in Python and C++.

### Resources and Tools

Our lab is equipped with a UR10 robot arm, an attached gripper, and the necessary software to control the robot's movements autonomously, including opening and closing the gripper. Additionally, we have an extensive dataset of objects with their geometric 3D models included (YCB dataset).

### Preferred Skills

- **Design**: Proficiency in CAD modeling and 3D printing.
- **Programming**: Strong experience in Python is essential. Experience in C++ is appreciated and might be useful.
- **Recommended Course**: While not required, taking my graduate course on Motion Planning (RB550) in Fall 2024 is highly recommended.
