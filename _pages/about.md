I am an Assistant Professor in [Robotics Engineering](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2023 at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Lydia Kavraki](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/lydia-e-kavraki)
 and [Dr. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/). I am honored to have received an [NSF-GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) fellowship for my doctoral studies.
I received my Diploma from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/) as an Electrical and Computer Engineer in 2017. 

My research interests lie in algorithmic robotics, focusing on integrating learning-based methods with classic robotic planning algorithms. The current research directions I am pursuing 
are in planning efficiency, planning under uncertainty, and planning from visual inputs. 

More details can be found in my [curriculum vitae](/assets/pdf/cv_cchamzas.pdf).
