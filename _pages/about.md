I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Lydia Kavraki](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/lydia-e-kavraki)
 and [Dr. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/). I am honored to have received an [NSF-GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) fellowship for my doctoral studies.


I received my Diploma from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/) as an Electrical and Computer Engineer in 2017. 
My research interests lie in algorithmic robotics, focusing on integrating learning-based methods with classic robotic planning algorithms.

 More details can be found in my [curriculum vitae](/assets/resume/cv_cchamzas.pdf).
