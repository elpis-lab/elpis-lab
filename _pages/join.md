### Ph.D. Students ###

Positions for Ph.D. are available each year for students with expertise in robotics, machine learning, or artificial intelligence. Prior experience in focus areas (motion-planning, reasoning with uncertainty, visual-based manipulation). Broadly speaking, we are looking for students with strong fundamentals who are interested in these focus areas and / or application domains.

If you are  interested please apply through the [WPI application portal](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/study/robotics-engineering-phd) for the Ph.D. program at the [Robotics Engineering Department](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering). WPI is one of the few places, worldwide, that has a dedicated robotics department. There is a serious emphasis on robotics as well as on creativity and innovation. It also offers one of the most competitive stipends in the U.S. with at least 39.000$ per year. 

Prospective applicants should have a background in CS, EE, ME, or a related field, and a passion for robotics! Preference will be given to those with relevant research experience, and a significant emphasis is placed on programming and/or hardware skills.

### WPI Master Students ###
Every year, there are several open positions for WPI Master's students. Please note that I typically accept students only after they have taken the [Motion-Planning (RBE550)](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/calendar-courses/course-descriptions/3911/robotics-engineering#RBE-550) course, which is taught in the Fall semester. This prerequisite ensures that students are well-prepared for the research work in the ELPIS lab.
