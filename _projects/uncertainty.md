Planning under uncertainty is a significant challenge in robotics, as robots often rely on incomplete geometric information due to sensing limitations. For instance, a robot might only have a partial view of an object, leading to collision with unseen parts. To address this, the ELPIS lab is conducting research in effective motion planning under uncertainty.
