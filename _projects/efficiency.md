Efficient computation of robot motion trajectories is crucial for deploying robots in time-constrained applications. Simple tasks like picking an object from a deep shelf remain challenging due to narrow navigation areas, often requiring minutes of computation. Leveraging past experiences can significantly reduce planning time, but effectively combining planning and learning is complex. ELPIS lab conducts research in this area aiming to advance the efficiency of motion planners in realistic scenarios. Additionally, the Lab is also interested in creating community accepted datasets to help evaluated objectively the progress in the field.
